Send to Taskforce Chrome Extension
==================================
**Version 1.1**

"Send your current page to the Taskforce task management app to remind you to look at it later, just as you can with an email. [Taskforce] (http://www.taskforceapp.com) is an addon for Gmail which builds high-quality email integrated task management into your workflow - it lets you convert the emails in your inbox into tasks, creating a whole new and helpful paradigm for managing your time.

Now, with Send to Taskforce for Chrome, you can do the same with web pages - take the web page you're currently viewing and add it to your Taskforce to-do list. Simply go onto the options page, set your username, password and list and then you can add tasks with a click of a button - simple!"

**This extension is open source, allowing those interested in the [Taskforce API](http://www.taskforceapp.com/api) to learn about how the API works, and how it can be used in a browser extension for Chrome.**

**If you're learning about the API, this might prove to be a helpful resource. Feel free to modify it as you wish and then do what you want with it - it's a resource designed for people to make use of.**

If you simply want to use the extension in your browser and you're a user of Taskforce, you can get it from the [Google Chrome extensions website](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/detail/hljhkedklaogpjkpflckfehiidocogjk/).
